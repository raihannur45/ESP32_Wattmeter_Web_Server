# Web Server Based Electrical Monitoring System
## Overview
Aim of this project is make a power outlet that can measure electricity current and power. The result can be read from the local web server for monitoring electricity usage.
## Tools
1. ESP32 as the microcontroller.
2. ACS712 as the current sensor that can read AC and DC current. For more information see the datasheet: http://www.allegromicro.com/~/media/files/datasheets/acs712-datasheet.ashx
3. Power Outlet. You can use any type of it depending on your country reference.
4. Breadboard and Jumper Cables to connect between ESP32 and ACS712.
